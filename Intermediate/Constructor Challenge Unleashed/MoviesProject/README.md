# Movie Tracker Program

## üöÄ **To-Do**

-  **Implement the program** to keep track of movies for movie fanatics:
      -  Create a `Movies` object.
      -  Ask the `Movies` object to add a movie by providing:
          - Movie name
          - Rating
          - Watched count
- Ask the `Movies` object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie, given its name.
- Ask the `Movies` object to display all of its movies.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Tasks**

- [x] Decided to use a `class Movie` to model individual movies:
  - [x] Movie name
  - [x] Movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
  - [x] Watched count

- [x] Understand the program flow for implementation and break it into files:
  - [x] **`Movie.h`**: Include file with the `Movie` class specification.
  - [x] **`Movie.cpp`**: File with the `Movie` class implementation.
  - [x] **`Movies.h`**: Include file with the `Movies` class specification.
  - [x] **`Movies.cpp`**: File with the `Movies` class implementation.
  - [x] **`main.cpp`**: Main driver file that creates a `Movies` object and manages the movies.

- [x] Create a **menu-driven system** for the user in the future.

## üü° **Partially Done**
- [x] "All done"

---

## üí° **Considerations**

- [ ] Add **advanced features**, such as:
  - Searching for movies by name or rating.
  - Sorting movies alphabetically or by rating.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Notes**

- The `Movies` class **must know about** the `Movie` class since it is a collection of `Movie` objects.
- The **main driver** should **only interact** with the `Movies` class.
- Handle edge cases:
  - Adding a movie whose name already exists should display an **error message** to the user.
  - Incrementing the watched count for a movie that does not exist should also display an **error message**.
